        Welcome to the PewdiePie's favourite blog about Software Engineering and today's
        topic is <b>Objects and Data Strcutures</b>...
    </p>
    <h3>Procedural vs Object Oriented programming</h3>
    <p>
        Before getting into the differences between these two imperative ways of writing code
        I would like to explain what subroutines are...
    </p>
    <h4>Subroutines</h4>
    <p>
        Subroutines are a sequence of programming instructions/expressions/clauses
        that performs a specific task. They are also known as functions/methods/procedures/subprograms 
        depending on the language.
        <br>
        Some say that these four are different. Maybe they are...but that's not the point.
    </p>
    <p>
        The intent behind them is <b>maintainability</b> becasue they increases
        the code reusability and readability. Larger and complex programs can be break down into
        little blocks.
        <br>
        That being said, now you know that the purpouse of creating them is to reuse blocks 
        of code or execute a specific task whenever it is needed but also create a structured
        code that is easier to read and mantain.
    </p>
    <p>
        Every subroutine have a way of receiving data (data input), processing data (body)
        and a return (branch back) to actually return a value (or not) to it's caller once the task
        is done.

        <br>
        They can be declared within a program or in separetaly libs, like the ones that are used to access system
        resources and services on linux operating system. A good example would be the GNU C Library. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm not getting much into this so I'm gonna put some good references at the end of the post
        if you want to explore more about subroutines and how they works in a more lower-level representation
        and hopefully I'm not getting any problems with copyright...
        <br>
        And here is a example of a subroutine/function in Python:
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: python">
<code>
def sum(first, second):
    return first + second
</code>
    </pre>
    <h4>Procedural Programming</h4>
    <h4>Object Oriented Programming</h4>

    <h3>Data Strctures</h3> 
    Good Luck XD
