        Welcome to the PewdiePie's favourite blog about Software Engineering and today
        we are with one more article about clean code talking about why comments can be bad for your code
        and how to set formatting rules so that your team can work with clean code principles in mind...
    </p>
    <p>
        So as I did on my last blog posts talking about <a href="https://gabrielslima.github.io/blog/post.html?id=6" target="blank"> 
        how I gave meaningful names to  my code </a> and how I use clean code
        principles to <a href="https://gabrielslima.github.io/blog/post.html?id=7" target="blank">create better functions</a>,
        I'm going to apply principles from the book Clean Code and try to illustrate them using my own code.
    </p>
    So without further ado let's get into it!
    <h3>Why comments are bad?</h3>
    <p>
        Lately I've been seeing code as a form of art. Wait...what?.Yeah, I know.
        <br>
        The last few months I've been looking at my code as a way of express my thoughts about something, about a solution.
        It's natural that when we enjoy doing something we want to do it well. Even if it's simple...well, at least I think in this
        way and I'm not better than anyone, of course.
        <br>
        But the thing is, when you have the opportunitty to come up with a solution you are expressing your way of thinking about the given context.
