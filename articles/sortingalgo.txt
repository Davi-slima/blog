Oh, hello and welcome.
<br>A few months ago I was wondering <q>What a good developer really knows?</q> because, you know,
I wanna be good...
So after a few days in the internet I found out that there is no correct answer but there is a few things that
are very common between the blog posts, YT videos, Instagram articles and so on.
One of them was algorithms.
<br>
<b>
Ok, at that point I already knew that, and basically what I do is "translate" my algorithms into code, duh.
<br>
The thing is, what kind of algorithms?
<br>
So, just to you know, if you work in Software factories you will be working in a lot of Software projects.
Proof of concept projects are pretty common, so that means that the System Design are probably different between the projects
and that the implemented algorithms are <q>different</q>.
<br>
So literally memorizing solutions from my perspective seems very...boring and a wast of time.
<b><span class="warnning">Wait, wait</span></b>,  I'm not saying that rework should be applied to <b>every</b> context, no.
What I'm saying is that memorizing algorithms are boring and there is no reason to memorize them at all.
<br>
<br>
If you have to sort a collection of items you probably will be using some libs availables in the internet like <span class="code">sort()</span>
in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sorted" _target="blank">Python Standar Library</a>.
<br>
<br>
Software Developers usually works in "agile teams" you know, isn't "agile" to write a sorting algorithm from scratch when you have issues in your name
and deadlines.
<br>
<br>
<h3>Why even bother learn it?</h3>
One day, coming back home I was thinking about all of this. <q>Why even bother? Why even care about it?</q>.
<br>
The truth is, programming is one of the things that is also my hobby, so many of my personal projects I did just because I wanted, 
and that is it.
Truth that I'm making money as a Software Engineer, but that is for another article, don't you think?
<br>
<br>
So if you don't know I dropped out from college, I can talk about <q>why</q> in a future article.
For now all you need to know is that my main pourpouse in the college was to collect knowledge about algorithms, datastructures
and Computer network.
<br>
That was the plan and eventually I found out that I already knew what was being taught in most of the classes 
and that the projects where just different.
So I did almost all of them, got an internship and got out.
<br>
<br>
I met many people from a CS background, like me, also self taught and that was great.
<br>
I didn't need to memorize a bubble sort algorithm to get a job, that was the first lesson.
Of course they need a guy to solve their problems, that's why they hired me, duh.
But, truth is that I never built a sorting algorithms from scratch because I never needed it.
<br>
<br>
The day that I was wondering I felt bored, I don't know why.
I was installing games on my smartphone, playing it for like 10 min and uninstalling it.
I was going throught Instagram posts and switching to WhatsApp and doing the same thing there.
I was trying to practice English with movies but bored of all the movies and without patience to see any different movie.

<br>
That's why thought <q>Why dont' build a sorting algorithm from scratch, without seen any classes?</q>
<br>
- <q>Aaah, What? Man are you crazy?</q>
<br>
Yeah, I know.
<br>
<br>

Even though I wasn't using that knowledge at my job it was cool to compare how I think with what is taught in books and so on.
<br>

<h3>How I thought?</h3>
Lets suppose that I have a list of prices, list of all RTX Graphics Cards and I wanna see from the lowest price to the highest.
<br>
All I had to do was to compare the last item with the previous item and change positions with the last one.
Something like this:
//IMAGE
<br>
Ok, know I have to go throught the list like that:
//IMAGE
So do you see?
<br>
the varable "i" is going from the last position to the first position.
<br>
Now i have to go again throught the list, but from the first item to the "i" position:
//IMAGE
<br>
Now I have to compare the current item in the list with the item of position  till compare with the item himself
