One of the most important things you can learn in programming is Clean Code.
<br>
Writing bad code can make things more complicated than they really are and forces you spend so much time
trying to figure out what one piece of code does before actually doing any work.
<br>
This situation can be solved by executing the piece of code giving them the proper data to process but 
what if you don't even know what is the data input and the piece of code has like 100 of lines with on for loop
behind the other? That makes things a little bit harder, isn't?
