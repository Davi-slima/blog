        Welcome to the PewdiePie's favourite blog about Software Engineering and today's
        topic is <b>formatting rules</b>. Formatting rules are super important when it comes
        to Clean Code.

        Professional developers knows that the first thing to be dealth with it before anything else is the
        <b>communication</b>. In the last blog posts I've been emphasizing that choosing good names,
        creating small functions instead of creating monsters and removing comments makes your code readable
        because by doing those thing you're removing the pollution and making things simple and easy to understand.

        All of those things are about the <b>communication</b> between you and other developers.
        <br>
        The way the code is written will affect every change in the future. So it's natural that if it's
        not well written the next changes will make it less readable and more complex...

        Formatting rules are a set of guidelines to help developers to write their code and a way of keeping
        the same code style on the project.

        Today we have tools like Sonarqube that allow us to set custom Quality Gates. Some of the formatting
        rules can be automated with it.
